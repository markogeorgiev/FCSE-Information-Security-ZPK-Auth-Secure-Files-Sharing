# Secure File Sharing Server with ZKP Authentication

This project combines a **Secure File Sharing Server (SFS)** with **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Authentication** to enhance privacy and security. Below is an explanation of how the system will work and how tasks can be divided between two collaborators.

---

## System Overview

The system is a web-based Secure File Sharing Server with the following features:
1. **ZKP-Based Authentication**:
   - Users authenticate without exposing sensitive information (e.g., passwords) by generating and validating ZK proofs.
2. **HTTPS for Secure Communication**:
   - OpenSSL is used to secure all communication channels over HTTPS.
3. **File Sharing Functionality**:
   - Users can upload, download, and share files securely with strict access controls.

## Implementation Details

### 1. ZKP-Based Authentication
- **ZKP Libraries**: Use tools like `libsnark`, `zk-SNARK`, or `circom` to implement ZKP.
- **Authentication Flow**:
  1. The client generates a ZK proof to prove they know a secret (e.g., password) without revealing it.
  2. The server validates the proof using a ZKP verifier.
  3. Upon successful verification, the user gains access to the system.

### 2. Secure File Sharing
- **HTTPS Setup**: Configure the server with OpenSSL to enable HTTPS for secure communication.
- **File Access**:
  - Provide APIs for file upload, download, and sharing.
  - Enforce access control based on authenticated user roles.
- **Optional**: Use OpenSSL for additional file encryption before storage.

### 3. Backend Server
- Use a framework like Flask or Node.js.
- Develop REST APIs for:
  - Authentication using ZKP.
  - File operations (upload, download, share).
- Handle ZKP proof validation within the authentication API.

### 4. Frontend Interface
- Build a simple web-based UI for:
  - User authentication using ZKP.
  - File management (upload, download, sharing).

### 5. Database
- Store user data, roles, and file metadata.
- Use a relational or NoSQL database, depending on requirements.

## Work Distribution

### Role 1: ZKP and Authentication Specialist
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Implement ZKP-based authentication using `libsnark` or `circom`.
  - Develop APIs to handle proof generation and verification.
  - Test the ZKP components for accuracy and security.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Ensure the authentication system integrates seamlessly with the backend.
  - Document how ZKP is used in the system.

### Role 2: SFS and System Integration Specialist
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Set up the secure file sharing backend and HTTPS using OpenSSL.
  - Develop REST APIs for file management.
  - Build a frontend for users to interact with the system.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Ensure secure file handling and access controls.
  - Work closely with the ZKP specialist to integrate authentication.

### Collaboration
- **Joint Tasks**:
  - Design the system architecture and workflows.
  - Conduct integration testing to ensure all components work together.
  - Share debugging and documentation tasks.
